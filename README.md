Pink
=========

An architectural Pattern for [Ink][i].

## Goals

This is an attempt at providing a reference implementation for rich client-side HTML5 apps using [Ink][i].

## What you get in the package

- Great "out of the box" look & feel, CSS & widgets provided by Ink.js lib.
- MVVM (Model, view, view model) architecture from the great Knockout.js lib.
- Re-usable convention for the application structure based on Ink's modules.
- Customizable application bootstrap (by hooks and plugins).
- Client-side navigation & routing (routie.js).
- Client-side signals/event bus for module decoupling (jssignals)
- Various data-bind ready components: Autocomplete, Drag&Drop, Kanban, Grid, Tooltip, ModalWindow, ...
